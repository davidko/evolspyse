                      Developer notes for spyse

Style
-----
* Docstrings should follow PEP 257 (http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html)
* Layout should follow PEP8 (http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html)
  + 4 spaces per indentation level
  + no tabs
  + module name: lower case without underscores
  + class name: 'CapWord'; private class name: '_CapWord';
    exception class name: 'CapWordError'
  + method/function name: lower case with underscores to separate name components
  + ditto for global variable name
  + instance method first argument: 'self'; class method first arg: 'cls'
  + a variable name can have trailing underscore to avoid clash with reserved word
  + a variable name can have one leading underscore to indicate privacy
  + a variable name can have two leading underscores to prevent name clashes with
    subclasses
* Use properties where possible
* Properties are implemented by calling the property function with the names of
  the get and set functions. The latter names should begin with double underscore
  unless the functions need to be overridden in descendent classes.


Policy
------
* setup() functions should not call ancestor setup() functions

Programming pitfalls
--------------------
* Creating a new mutable type per instance:

Pyro
----
Mostly we use Pyro proxies without attribute access support.  This means that
remote access to attributes must be provided by means of getters and setters.
